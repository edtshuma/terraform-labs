Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.identity.aws_iam_group.developers will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_group" "developers" {
      + arn       = (known after apply)
      + id        = (known after apply)
      + name      = "developers"
      + path      = "/"
      + unique_id = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + iam_developers_group_arn = (known after apply)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
