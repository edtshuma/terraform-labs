Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.identity.aws_iam_policy.developers_s3_ec2_policy will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_policy" "developers_s3_ec2_policy" {

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
